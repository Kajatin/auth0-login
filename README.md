This action logs into Auth0 and returns the access token.

## Usage

<!-- start usage -->

```yaml
- uses: Kajatin/auth0-login@v1
  with:
    # The Auth0 tenant domain to request the access token from.
    tenant-url: 'https://your-tenant.auth0.com'

    # The client ID of the application that is requesting the access token.
    # Required: true
    client-id: 'xD3f4u1t'

    # The client secret of the application that is requesting the access token.
    # Required: true
    client-secret: 's3cr3t'

    # The audience of the access token.
    audience: ''

    # The grant type of the access token.
    # Default: client_credentials
    grant-type: ''
```

<!-- end usage -->

## Outputs

If the action successfully logs into Auth0, it will return the following
outputs:

- `access-token`: The access token that was retrieved from Auth0.

## How to update the action

1. Create a new branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b releases/v1
   ```

1. Replace the contents of `src/` with your action code
1. Add tests to `__tests__/` for your source code
1. Format, test, and build the action

   ```bash
   npm run all
   ```

   > This step is important! It will run [`ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc)
   > to build the final JavaScript action code with all dependencies included.
   > If you do not run this step, your action will not work correctly when it is
   > used in a workflow. This step also includes the `--license` option for
   > `ncc`, which will create a license file for all of the production node
   > modules used in your project.

1. Commit your changes

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "My first action is ready!"
   ```

1. Push them to your repository

   ```bash
   git push -u origin releases/v1
   ```

1. Create a pull request and get feedback on your action
1. Merge the pull request into the `main` branch

The action is now published! :rocket:

## Publishing a new release

This project includes a helper script, [`script/release`](./script/release)
designed to streamline the process of tagging and pushing new releases for
GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. This script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent release tag by looking at the local data available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the latest release tag
   and provides a regular expression to validate the format of the new tag.
1. **Tagging the new release:** Once a valid new tag is entered, the script tags
   the new release.
1. **Pushing the new tag to the remote:** Finally, the script pushes the new tag
   to the remote repository. From here, you will need to create a new release in
   GitHub and users can easily reference the new tag in their workflows.
